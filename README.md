# ISO2-2023-A04-Testing-P1

First testing exercise.

## Statement

The task is to write and test a Persona class that initializes objects with valid states. The data for
each Persona object includes name, last name, date of birth, nationality, education, English
certification, phone number, and email. Additionally, considering the problemâ€™s semantics, we
are interested in including methods that help determine if the person is of legal age and if they
are European. Please, to the extent possible, value the management and use of exceptions and
the possibility of creating a program that uses the Persona class
